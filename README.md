 Kultra Mega Stores Inventory Analysis (SQL Case Study)
🏢 Project Overview
This project analyzes four years (2009–2012) of order data from Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), a Lagos-based retailer specializing in office supplies and furniture. As a Business Intelligence Analyst supporting the Abuja division, I was tasked with extracting insights that inform business decisions using SQL Server.

The dataset was imported from Excel into a SQL database and cleaned using SQL transformations. Analysis was carried out using SQL queries that answer business-relevant questions.

🎯 Objectives
Identify top-performing products, regions, and customer segments.

Uncover inefficiencies in shipping and pricing.

Recommend strategies to improve revenue and profitability.

Analyze customer behaviors across Retail, Consumer, and Corporate segments.

❓ Questions Analyzed
🔷 Case Scenario I: Sales & Operations
Which product category had the highest sales?

What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?

What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?

Advise the management on how to increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers.

Which shipping method incurred the highest shipping cost?

🔷 Case Scenario II: Customer Intelligence
Who are the most valuable customers, and what do they typically purchase?

Which small business customer had the highest sales?

Which corporate customer placed the most number of orders (2009–2012)?

Which consumer customer was the most profitable?

Which customers returned items and what segment do they belong to?

Was the company’s shipping spend aligned with order priority? (Cost vs Speed Analysis)
